What is Binary Tree Data Structure?
Binary Tree is defined as a Tree data structure with at most 2 children. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child.

Binary Tree Data Structure


Binary Tree Representation

A Binary tree is represented by a pointer to the topmost node of the tree. If the tree is empty, then the value of the root is NULL.

Binary Tree node contains the following parts:

Data
Pointer to left child
Pointer to right child

Basic Operation On Binary Tree:
Inserting an element.
Removing an element.
Searching for an element.
Traversing an element.

Auxiliary Operation On Binary Tree:
Finding the height of the tree
Find the level of the tree
Finding the size of the entire tree.
